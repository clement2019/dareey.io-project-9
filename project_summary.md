TOLLING WEBSITE-GITHUB CONTINOUS INTEGRATION CI USING JENKINS SOLUTION

For this project i used two Ubuntun Linux distribution 20.04 servers one is the jenkins server configured while the one is the NFS! server configured in previouse projects
In this project i made sure any change events in the github is reflected on the tooling website using jenkins as a continous integration,this was made posible through 
the use of webhook.I also demonstrated that using publish ssh one of the pulugins on jenkins we can configured Jenkins to copy files to NFS server via SSH from the github repository and it will reflect on /mnt folder of the NFS server using ssh connection.
All these were fiully implemented and demonstrated in this project
